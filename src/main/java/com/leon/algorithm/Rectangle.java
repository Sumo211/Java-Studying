 * What if there is no intersection?
 * What if one rectangle is entirely contained in the other?
 * What if the rectangles don't really intersect but share an edge?
 * Do some parts of your method seem very similar? Can they be refactored so you repeat yourself less?
 * The hard part isn't the time or space optimizationâ€”it's getting something that works and is readable.
 * To keep your thoughts clear and avoid bugs, take time to:
 * 1. Think up and draw out all the possible cases.
 * 2. Use very specific and descriptive variable names.
 * O(1) time and O(1) space
